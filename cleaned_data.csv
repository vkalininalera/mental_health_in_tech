so yeah  please get more intersectional in how you survey this landscape im screwed not just because of my disabilitiesbut my gender as well

sooo  this survey should have a did we miss anything open question at the end two things one  my adhd is an asset when treated and understoodalso  when i finally got coverage at work  years agoi was put on a med which i had a very bad reaction to  at work getting treated after decades ended up cratering my worklife for ten years or so wrong meds really messed me up  along with wrong dx i couldnt be open about it and then had a serious breakdown at workand was fired immediately no mercy no understanding  i told them what was going on and i was gone because i wasnt well i couldnt defend myself i became homeless for a while im ok nowbut it was a mess caused by getting poor medical treatment for pretty run of the mill depressioni was in silicon valley at the time and over  and female there was no space for me to be anything less that  perfect as i was one of very few women working in sv at the time"
